You Had Me At Hello World

Because in modern programming languages "Hello, World!" is too simple.  You don't learn anything.  We can do better.

1. HTTP GET example.com
2. Regex title out of HTML<sup>*</sup>
3. Reverse string
4. Write to a text file called output.txt
5. Verify output.txt exists containing **niamoD elpmaxE**
6. ????
7. Profit

<sup>*</sup> [The pony... he comes.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags) Yes, I know. But using a parser prevents learning regex in a new language, which is the sole purpose of this exercise.  This is not a generalized solution.  I would never suggest parsing HTML with regex in production code.  Please put down your BeautifulSoup pitchforks.
